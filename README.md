# godot-experiments
Just some simple experiments using Godot

This repository is just a bunch of small experiments with Godot.
Just needed a place to store them and don't want to make separate repositories for every small thing I dabble ^^

Every folder is a Godot project on it's own.
So if you want to clone this repository, you can easily scan this base folder to check out all the experiments.

They are:

`/snake` - A snake game where you grow if you pick up some _candy_ and you die if you touch your own tail
